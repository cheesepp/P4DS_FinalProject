## Motivation

- Mental health is one of the important aspects of human healthcare. However, I observed that many people do not nither believe in mental illness nor give it the same importance as physical illnesses when they encounter it. This motivated me to analyze a dataset related to mental health and get some insights into people's behaviors relating to it.
